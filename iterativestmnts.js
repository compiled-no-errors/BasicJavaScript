//conditional statements 

var a = 9 ;
var b = true ;
var c = false ;
var d = 9 ;

if(a == d){
    console.log("ABC");   // this will work as usual
}

if(h = -111){
    console.log("ty"); 
}

//the above will work cause true means non zero

if (k = 0) {  //remember = is assignment operator while == is comparsion operator
    console.log("joke"); // this wont enter the loop as false = 0
}

//by default k is variable (var)
//in conclusion non zero is true

// java script is not of a strict nature
